# TODO

* Basic pool bench

* Stacking
* Check components (chance, cooldown, mana use)
* Targeting (deal damage to enemy, heal self)

* Don't make a new modifier before we know we can apply it (improves performance). Because we might just stack/init/refresh the current one.
* Have two ways to apply a modifier? One for modifier's with a state? One for without only through ID?
* How many time modifiers can we run?
* Take modifier ideas & test modifiers from original library. Import their mechanics in an improved way here
