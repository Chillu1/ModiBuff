# What is this?

This zero dependency, engine-agnostic library was made to make a standardized powerful system that allows for
manipulation of effects on entities.

**It focuses on Feature Set, Performance and Ease of use, in that order.**

The library is split into two core parts:

ModiBuff is the core backend part that handles all the modifier logic and is mostly unopinionated when it comes to the
game logic.

Meanwhile ModiBuff.Units is a fully featured implementation of the library, that showcases how to tie the library into a
game.

> Note: The library is currently in development, and it will most likely encounter breaking API changes.

## Why do I need this?

The vast majority of games make their own buff/debuff systems, to fit their game logic.
Examples of this are: Dota 2, League of Legends, Path of Exile, Diablo, World of Warcraft, etc.

While this is a great approach, it's also very time consuming, and requires a fair amount of research to design well.

This library solves that, but also allows for more complex and deeper modifiers than the aforementioned games.

Setting up all recipes, with 64 pool allocation per recipe takes 60ns, and 104KB.

Pre-allocating 1_000 modifiers of each recipe (currently 100±) takes 67ms, and 35MB.

Pooling in ModiBuff is 500X faster than original old version (because of pool rent & return)  
But it's also much faster in cases of doing init/stack/refresh on an existing modifier (we don't create a new modifier
anymore)  
ModiBuffEcs is a bit on the slow side for now, because of how pooling works, with enabling and disabling entities.

*NoOp is an empty effect, so it just measures the benchmark time of the library without unit logic (ex. taking
damage).  
**DoT = InitDoTSeparateDamageRemove

# Requirements

ModiBuff is compatible with .NETStandard 1.1 and .NETStandard 2.0, C# 7.2 (C# 7.0 is also possible, take a look
at [Godot Branch](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/tree/feature/godot-compatible))

For development net 6.0 is required to build and run all tests. The tests depend on NUnit, and benchmarks depend on
BenchmarkDotNet.

# Installation

Currently the library is on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModiBuff/) and
[Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2166), it will also be coming to Unity Asset Store
soon.

## Step by step installation

1. Download the latest DLL from [Releases](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/releases) or ModiBuff source code.
2. Add the DLL to your project.
3. Make your own `ModifierRecipes` class that either
   [inherits](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/blob/d56ab4d1748e483a638b9ef7169a07413dbe3957/ModiBuff/ModiBuff.Units/TestModifierInheritanceRecipes.cs)
   from `ModiBuff.ModifierRecipes`or
   [encapsulates](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/blob/d56ab4d1748e483a638b9ef7169a07413dbe3957/ModiBuff/ModiBuff.Units/TestModifierRecipes.cs)
   it and fill it with your modifier recipes.
4. Make your own logger implementation, by inheriting `ILogger`, or use one of the built-in ones.
5. Call ModiBuff setup systems in the initialization of your game.    
   5.1. You can change the internal config values inside `Config`

```csharp
Logger.SetLogger<MyLogger>();
//Config.MaxPoolSize = 10000;

var idManager = new ModifierIdManager();
_recipes = new ModifierRecipes(idManager); //Your version of ModifierRecipes
_pool = new ModifierPool(_recipes);
```

If you want to use the Units implementation, go to [ModiBuff.Units](#modibuffunits).
Otherwise go to [Custom Units](#custom-units).

### ModiBuff.Units

6. Download the latest ModiBuff.Units DLL from [Releases](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/releases) or ModiBuff
   source code.
7. Add the DLL to your project.
8. Now you can create your units, and apply modifiers to them.

### Custom Units

6. Implement `IUnit` and `IModifierOwner` interfaces on your unit class.  
   6.1. Optionally add some of the ModiBuff.Units `IUnit` [interfaces](ModiBuff/ModiBuff.Units/Unit/Interfaces) that you
   want to use.
7. Create your own interfaces that your effects will use, and implement them on your unit class.

# Usage

## Recipe

Modifier Recipes are the high level API for creating modifiers, they use the builder pattern/method chaining/fluent
interface to create modifiers (without the need for calling a Finish/Complete method).

Easiest modifier, that does 5 damage when added, can be created like this:

```csharp
Add("InitDamage")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Init);
```

More advanced damage over time modifier, with 10 damage when added, and 5 damage per interval.  
Removed after 3 seconds, with the duration being refreshable.

```csharp
Add("Init_DoT_Remove_Refreshable")
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(10), EffectOn.Init)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Remove(3)
    .Refresh();
```

You're also able to create modifiers with same effect instance on multiple actions.  
Ex. Same damage on Init and Interval.
> Note: init will be triggered each time we try to add the modifier to the unit (unless we set `.OneTimeInit()`).

```csharp
Add("InitDoT")
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(10), EffectOn.Init | EffectOn.Interval);
``` 

Any IEffect can be added.  
Ex. simple stun effect

```csharp
Add("InitStun")
    .Effect(new StatusEffectEffect(StatusEffectType.Stun, 2), EffectOn.Init)
    .Remove(2);
```

## In-depth Recipe Creation

Every modifier needs a unique name.
It will be registered under this name in the backend,
and assigned an unique ID.

```csharp
Add("ModifierName")
```

Recipes have a methods that determine the functionality of the made modifier.

### Effect

The main method to setup effects is `Effect(IEffect, EffectOn, Targeting)`.  
`IEffect` is the effect that will be applied to the unit, it can be anything, as long as it implements IEffect
interface.  
`EffectOn` is the action that will trigger the effect: Init, Interval, Duration, Stack.
`EffectOn` is a flag enum, so the effect can be triggered on multiple actions.  
`Targeting` tells the effect how it should be targeted, if we should target the owner (source) of the modifier, or the
targeted unit.
If you're unsure what this means, leave it at default. There will be more examples of this later.

```csharp
Add("InitDamage")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Init);
```

### Interval

The first most common action method is `Interval(float)`. It's used to set the interval of the modifier.
And interval effects will be triggered every X seconds.

```csharp
Add("IntervalDamage")
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Interval);
```

### Duration

Next is `Duration(float)`. It's used to set the duration of the duration effects. It's usually used to remove the
modifier after X seconds.
But it can be used for any effect.
> Note: When we want to remove the modifier after X seconds, it's simpler to use the `Remove(float)` method,
> which is just a QoL wrapper for `Duration(float)`.

```csharp
Add("InitDamageDurationRemove")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Init)
    .Effect(new RemoveEffect(), EffectOn.Duration)
    .Duration(5);
```

### Refresh

Then we have `Refresh(RefreshType)` method. That makes either the interval or duration component refreshable.
Meaning that if a modifier gets added again to a unit, it will refresh the timer. This is most often used with the
duration timer.

```csharp
Add("DamageOverTimeRefreshableDuration")
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Effect(new RemoveEffect(), EffectOn.Duration)
    .Duration(5)
    .Refresh(RefreshType.Duration);
```

Calling `Refresh()` without any arguments will make the last time (interval/duration) component refreshable.

```csharp
Add("DamageOverTimeRefreshableDuration")
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Effect(new RemoveEffect(), EffectOn.Duration)
    .Duration(5).Refresh();
```

### Stack

Then there's `Stack(WhenStackEffect whenStackEffect, float value, int maxStacks, int everyXStacks)`.
It's used for tracking how many times the modifier has been re-added to the unit, or other stacking logic.

`WhenStackEffect` tells the modifier when the stack action should be triggered: Always, OnMaxStacks, EveryXStacks,
etc.  
`StackEffectType` tells the effect what to do when the stack action is triggered:
Trigger it's effect, add to it's effect, or both or all, etc.

In this example we deal 5 damage every 1 second, but each time we add the modifier, we add 2 damage to the effect.
Resulting in 7 damage every 1 second with 1 stack. 9 with 2 stacks, etc.

```csharp
Add("StackableDamage_DamageOverTime")
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5, StackEffectType.Add), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.Always, value: 2);
```

### OneTimeInit & Aura

`OneTimeInit()` makes the modifier only trigger the init effect once, when it's added to the unit.
Any subsequent adds will not trigger the init effects, but refresh and stack effects will still work as usual.
This is very useful for aura modifiers, where we don't want to stack the aura effect.

For partial aura functionality, we can tell the recipe that it will trigger effects on multiple units at once
with `Aura()`.

```csharp
Add("InitAddDamageBuff")
    .OneTimeInit()
    .Effect(new AddDamageEffect(5, true), EffectOn.Init)
    .Remove(1.05f).Refresh();
Add("InitAddDamageBuff_Interval")
    .Aura()
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("InitAddDamageBuff"), EffectOn.Interval);
```

### InstanceStackable

`InstanceStackable()` makes the modifier instance stackable,meaning that we can have
multiple instances of the same modifier on the same unit.

This will impose a slight performance penalty, and will require to use unique `genId` for each instance.

This example deals 5 damage every 1 second, the remove timer can't be refreshed by normal means.
And each new call to add the modifier will add a new instance of the modifier.

```csharp
AddRecipe("InstanceStackableDoT")
    .InstanceStackable()
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Remove(5);
```

### Meta-Effect

Effects can store meta effects, that will manipulate the effect values with optional conditions.
Meta effects, just like normal effects, are user-generated. Note that meta-effect can't have **mutable** state.
Any mutable state should be stored in the effect itself or on the unit.
Effects support many meta effects after each other. Allowing for very complex interactions.

This example scales our 5 damage value based on the source unit's health times some multiplier.

```csharp
Add("InitDamageValueBasedOnHealthMeta")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5)
        .SetMetaEffects(new StatPercentMetaEffect(StatType.Health, Targeting.SourceTarget)), EffectOn.Init);
```

### Post-Effect

Post-effects can be chained with meta-effects.

Post effects are effects that are applied after the main effect. And use the main effect as a source for their values.
Most common example of this is lifesteal, where we deal damage, and then heal for a percentage of the damage dealt.
Post effects also can't have any mutable state, and work fully in conjunction with meta effects.

This example deals 5 damage on init, and then heals for 50% of the damage dealt.

```csharp
Add("InitDamageLifeStealPost")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5)
        .SetPostEffects(new LifeStealPostEffect(0.5f, Targeting.SourceTarget)) , EffectOn.Init);
```

### Apply & Effect Condition (checks)

Modifiers can have conditions, that will check if the modifier/target/source fulfills the condition before applying the
modifier.
`ModiBuff.Units` has a few built-in conditions, and custom conditions are fully supported.
The common conditions are: cooldown, mana cost, chance, status effect, etc.

This example deals 5 damage on init apply, only if:
the source unit has at least 5 mana, passes the 50% roll, is not on 1 second cooldown, source is able to act (attack,
heal), and target is silenced.

```csharp
Add("InitDamage_CostMana")
    .ApplyCost(CostType.Mana, 5)
    .ApplyChance(0.5f)
    .ApplyCooldown(1f)
    .ApplyCondition(LegalAction.Act)
    .EffectCondition(LegalAction.Silence)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Init);
```

### Event

Events are a way to call effects on certain unit events.
Examples of this are: When Attacked, When Killed, On Attack, On Kill, On Cast, etc.

Some common examples of this are: thorns, restore health on cast, add damage on kill.

In this example we deal 5 damage to a unit that attacks us.

```csharp
Add("ThornsOnHitEvent")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Event, Targeting.SourceTarget)
    .Event(EffectOnEvent.WhenAttacked);
```

### Callback

Callbacks work like events, but have extra functionality, like being able to remove the modifier on callback.

Callbacks are a way to add logic that can be triggered on any user/game-based action.
This is particularly useful for removing modifiers on certain non-standard cases.

In this example we add 5 damage to unit on Init, and the modifier can only be removed if the unit gets hit by a "
StrongHit".
Essentially a hit that deals more than half units health in damage (ex. game logic).

```csharp
Add("InitAddDamageRevertibleHalfHealthCallback")
    .Effect(new AddDamageEffect(5, true), EffectOn.Init)
    .Remove(RemoveEffectOn.Callback)
    .Callback(CallbackType.StrongHit);
```

It's possible to use any IEffect for callbacks,
so we can for example heal the unit to full health every time they get hit by a "StrongHit".

```csharp
Add("InitHealToFullWhenStrongHitCallback")
    .Effect(new HealEffect(0)
        .SetMetaEffects(new AddValueBasedOnStatDiffMetaEffect(StatType.MaxHealth)), EffectOn.Callback)
    .Callback(CallbackType.StrongHit);
```

#### Callback Unit delegate

There's another version of callbacks, based on delegates instead of IEffects.
It can be useful for simple one-off effects.

```csharp
Add("InitHealToFullHalfHealthCallback")
    .Callback(CallbackType.StrongHit, (target, source) =>
    {
        var damageable = (IDamagable<float, float>)target;
        ((IHealable<float, float>)target).Heal(damageable.MaxHealth - damageable.Health, source);
    });
```

> Note that no effect or state can be defined or saved here, being mostly a downside.

### Modifier Actions

Sometimes we need extra control of what happens inside the modifier, with game logic.
This can be achieved with modifier actions, currently there's two: Refresh and ResetStacks.

Here we have a delayed add damage, that triggers after 2 seconds.
But if a unit takes a "StrongHit", it will reset the timer.

```csharp
Add("DurationAddDamageStrongHitRefresh")
    .Effect(new AddDamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Duration)
    .ModifierAction(ModifierAction.Refresh, EffectOn.Callback)
    .Callback(CallbackType.StrongHit)
    .Duration(2).Refresh();
```

Here we add damage every 5 stacks of the modifier.
But if a unit takes a "StrongHit", it will reset the stacks count to 0.

```csharp
Add("StackAddDamageStrongHitResetStacks")
    .Effect(new AddDamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Stack)
    .ModifierAction(ModifierAction.ResetStacks, EffectOn.Callback)
    .Callback(CallbackType.StrongHit)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.EveryXStacks, everyXStacks: 5);
```

### Tags

Tags are a way to mark modifiers, there are a few internal tags that tell the `ModifierController` how the modifiers
should be handled. Tags are stored inside `ModifierRecipes` and can only be set on modifier generator creation.

Then there's a few other internal tags that are there for the user:
IsInstanceStackable, IntervalIgnoresStatusResistance and DurationIgnoresStatusResistance.

There's also a `TagType.Default` which we can use in the beginning to define our default tags in the config.
`Config.DefaultTag = /*Your*/TagType.Default;`

But tagging also supports user-defined tags, that can be used for any purpose.

`ModiBuff.Units` uses it to implement legal targeting for modifiers.
We need to respect the last reserved tag in `ModiBuff.Core.TagType`.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum TagType : ulong
{
    Default = Core.TagType.Default | LegalTargetAll,

    LastReserved = Core.TagType.LastReserved,

    LegalTargetSelf = 1ul << 17,
    LegalTargetAlly = 1ul << 18,
    LegalTargetEnemy = 1ul << 19,

    LegalTargetAll = LegalTargetSelf | LegalTargetAlly | LegalTargetEnemy,
    //UserTag5 = 1ul << 21
}
```

Then we can define some helper extension methods for checking if a unit is a legal target of the modifier.

```csharp
public static bool IsLegalTarget(this int modifierId, IUnitEntity target, IUnitEntity source)
{
    var tag = (TagType)ModifierRecipes.GetTag(modifierId);
    if (tag.HasTag(TagType.LegalTargetSelf) && target == source)
    	return true;

    return tag.IsLegalTarget(target.UnitType, source.UnitType);
}
```

```csharp
public static bool IsLegalTarget(this TagType tag, UnitType target, UnitType source)
{
    if (tag.HasTag(TagType.LegalTargetAlly) && target == source)
        return true;
    if (tag.HasTag(TagType.LegalTargetEnemy) && target != source)
        return true;
    if (tag.HasTag(TagType.LegalTargetAll))
        return true;

#if DEBUG
    Logger.Log($"Tag {tag} is not a legal target for UnitType.{target} from UnitType.{source}");
#endif
    return false;
}
```

So we can finally setup our own tag for modifiers.

> Note that we're also using a default tag that sets all modifiers to be legal to target all units.
> So we need to remove that tag first.

```csharp
Add("InitDamageEnemyOnly")
    .RemoveTag((Core.TagType)LegalTarget.All)
    .Tag((Core.TagType)TagType.LegalTargetEnemy)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5f), EffectOn.Init);
```

Then we can make a extension method for our logic, so we don't use the previous verbose `Tag` approach.

```csharp
public static ModifierRecipe LegalTarget(this ModifierRecipe recipe, LegalTarget target)
{
    recipe.RemoveTag((Core.TagType)TagType.LegalTargetAll);
    return recipe.Tag(target.ToTagType());
}
```

```csharp
Add("InitDamageEnemyOnly")
	.LegalTarget(LegalTarget.Enemy)
	.Effect(new DamageEffect(5f), EffectOn.Init);
```

### Order

Functions should be used in the operation order, for clarity.
This is optional, except for parameterless refresh functions, which should be called right after interval/duration.

```csharp
Add("Full")
    .OneTimeInit()
    .ApplyCondition(ConditionType.HealthIsFull)
    .ApplyCooldown(1)
    .ApplyCost(CostType.Mana, 5)
    .ApplyChance(0.5f)
    .EffectCondition(ConditionType.HealthIsFull)
    .EffectCooldown(1)
    .EffectCost(CostType.Mana, 5)
    .EffectChance(0.5f)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Init)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Stack)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.EveryXStacks, everyXStacks: 2)
    .Interval(1)
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(2), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Remove(5).Refresh()
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(8), EffectOn.Duration);
```

Each modifier should have at least one effect, unless it's used as a flag.

## Recipe Limitations

> Note that these limitations don't matter for 95% of the use cases.

* One Interval Component
* One Duration Component
* One Modifier Check for all effects
* Same Checks (cost, chance, cooldown) for all effects

## Adding Modifiers To Units

There's multiple ways to add modifiers to a unit.

For normal modifiers, the best approach is to use `IModifierOwner.TryAddModifier(int, IUnit)`.
By feeding the modifier ID, and the source unit.

For applier (attack, cast, etc) modifiers, `IModifierOwner.ModifierController.TryAddApplier(int, bool, ApplierType)`
should be used.

Currently for aura modifiers it has to be implemented directly into the unit. An example of this can be found
in `CoreUnits.Unit.AddAuraModifier(int)`.

This is also the case for unit events, like `OnKill`, `OnAttack`, `WhenDeath`, etc.
Through `IEventOwner.AddEffectEvent(IEffect, EffectOnEvent)`.

## Effect

### Making New Effects

The library allows for easy creation of new effects.
Which are needed for using custom game-based logic.

Effects have to implement `IEffect`.  
They can also implement `ITargetEffect` for event targeting owner/source,
`IStackEffect` for stacking functionality, `IStateEffect` for resetting runtime state.

For fully featured effect implementation, look at
[DamageEffect](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/blob/master/ModiBuff/ModiBuff.Units/Effects/DamageEffect.cs)

#### In-depth Effect Creation

We start by creating a new class that implements `IEffect`.  
`IEffect` has a method `void Effect(IUnit target, IUnit source);` that gets fed the target and source of the
cast/attack/apply.

The next important thing is to identify if our effect will have mutable state.
It will have state if we plan on reverting it, adding more value to it, or changing internal effect state.
In that case, we need to implement `IStateEffect`, which has a method `void ResetState();` that gets called when the
modifier is sent back to pool, and also a clone `IEffect ShallowClone()` method. For cloning the effect so the state is
not shared between modifiers.

If we want to use stack logic, the effect needs to implement `IStackEffect`.

If the effect should support non-standard targeting, it should implement `ITargetEffect`.

The effects hould have two constructors, the first main one should be used for recipes,
and only expose the non-recipe setting variables.
The other constructor should be in a factory pattern style, and expose all the variables.

### Applier Effect

Hands down, the most powerful effect is the ApplierEffect.  
It's used to apply other modifiers to units. While being able to use modifier logic, like stacks.  
This can create some very sophisticated modifiers:

```csharp
//WhenAttacked ApplyModifier. Every5Stacks this modifier adds a new ^ rupture modifier
AddRecipe("ComplexApplier_OnHit_Event")
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier_Rupture"), EffectOn.Event, Targeting.SourceTarget)
    .Event(EffectOnEvent.WhenAttacked);

//rupture modifier, that does DoT. When this gets to 5 stacks, apply the disarm effect.
Add("ComplexApplier_Rupture")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Interval)
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier_Disarm"), EffectOn.Stack)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.EveryXStacks, everyXStacks: 5);

//Disarm the target for 5 seconds. On 2 stacks, removable in 10 seconds, refreshable.
Add("ComplexApplier_Disarm")
    .Effect(new StatusEffectEffect(StatusEffectType.Disarm, 5, false, StackEffectType.Effect), EffectOn.Stack)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.EveryXStacks, everyXStacks: 2)
    .Remove(10)
    .Refresh();
```

The next one is very complex, but it shows the power of the ApplierEffect.  
Obviously the effects can be whatever we want. Damage, Stun, etc.

Add damage on 4 stacks buff, that you give someone when they heal you 5 times, for 60 seconds.  
To clarify:

* Player heals ally 5 times, gets buff
* Player attacks an enemy 4 times, gets damage buff
* Player buff gets removed after 60 seconds

```csharp            
//Apply the modifier to source (healer) WhenHealed                                   
Add("ComplexApplier2_WhenHealed_Event")               
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier2_WhenHealed"), EffectOn.Event, Targeting.SourceTarget)
    .Event(EffectOnEvent.WhenHealed);

//On 5 stacks, apply the modifier to self.
Add("ComplexApplier2_WhenHealed")                                                    
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier2_OnAttack_Event"), EffectOn.Stack)     
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.EveryXStacks, everyXStacks: 5)
    .Remove(5).Refresh();

//Long main buff. Apply the modifier OnAttack.
Add("ComplexApplier2_OnAttack_Event")
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier2_WhenAttacked_Event"), EffectOn.Event)
    .Event(EffectOnEvent.OnAttack)
    .Remove(60).Refresh();

Add("ComplexApplier2_WhenAttacked_Event")
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier2_AddDamageAdd"), EffectOn.Event, Targeting.SourceTarget)
    .Event(EffectOnEvent.WhenAttacked)
    .Remove(5).Refresh();

//On 4 stacks, Add Damage to Unit source (attacker).
Add("ComplexApplier2_AddDamageAdd")
    .Effect(new ApplierEffect("ComplexApplier2_AddDamage"), EffectOn.Stack)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.EveryXStacks, everyXStacks: 4)
    .Remove(5).Refresh();

//AddDamage 5, one time init, remove in 10 seconds, refreshable.
Add("ComplexApplier2_AddDamage")
    .OneTimeInit()
    .Effect(new AddDamageEffect(5, true), EffectOn.Init)
    .Remove(10).Refresh();
```

## Modifier

Modifiers are the core backend part of the library, they are the things that are applied to entities with effects on
certain actions. Ex. Init, Interval, Duration, Stack.  
You **CAN'T** use the Modifier class directly, use the recipe system.
Recipe system fixes a lot of internal complexity of setting up modifiers for you.

It's possible to make modifier directly by using `ManualModifierGenerator` class,
specifically `ModifierRecipes.Add(string, string, string, ModifierGeneratorFunc, Tag)` method.
But only do so if you really know what you're doing, and need that extra functionality like multiple interval/duration
components, react callbacks, etc.

### Manual Modifier Generation

Manual modifier generation is not a "first-class citizen" in the library,
but it does support all the bleeding edge features that aren't supported in recipes yet.

Here's a basic implementation of the classic 5 damage on init modifier. First as recipe, then as manual modifier.

```csharp
Add("InitDamage")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5), EffectOn.Init);
```

We need to always supply a `TargetComponent`, and id, genId and name need to fed to the modifier.

```csharp
Add("InitDamageManual", "", "", (id, genId, name, tag) =>
{
    var initComponent = new InitComponent(false, new IEffect[] { new DamageEffect(5) }, null);

    return new Modifier(id, genId, name, initComponent, null, null, null,
    	new SingleTargetComponent(), null);
}/*>Supply possible tags here<*/);
```

As we can see there's a lot of manual setup, but this gives us more control over the modifier.
We can have multiple interval and duration components, with different unique effects.

We don't need to tag if our effect is init, stack or refresh.
Since it's done automatically by the library through reflection.

Some effects have special constructors for manual modifier generation,
where you can supply the needed parameters directly.
For example effects that hold instance info.

```csharp
var effect = StatusEffectEffect.Create(id, genId, StatusEffectType.Sleep, 5f, true);
```

#### React Callbacks

One reason to use manual modifier generation right now is to use react callbacks (not supported yet in recipes).

This example applies a sleep effect for 5 seconds, but if the unit takes 10 damage,
it reverts the sleep effect and the modifier.

We're using factory pattern constructors here for the effects,
since they need the id and genId to work with modifier instances.

```csharp
Add("InitStatusEffectSleep_RemoveOnTenDamageTaken", (id, genId, name, tag) =>
{
    var effect = StatusEffectEffect.Create(id, genId, StatusEffectType.Sleep, 5f, true);
    var removeEffect = RemoveEffect.Create(id, genId);

    float totalDamageTaken = 0f;
    var @event = new HealthChangedEvent((target, source, health, deltaHealth) =>
    {
    	totalDamageTaken += deltaHealth;
    	if (totalDamageTaken >= 10)
    		removeEffect.Effect(target, source);
    });
    var registerReactEffect = new ReactCallbackRegisterEffect<ReactType>(
    	new ReactCallback<ReactType>(ReactType.CurrentHealthChanged, @event));

    //Order of reverts matters here, if we revert the captured variable after
    //it will trigger a recursive effect, because the captured variable will never be reset
    removeEffect.SetRevertibleEffects(new IRevertEffect[]
    	{ effect, new RevertActionEffect(() => { totalDamageTaken = 0f; }), registerReactEffect });

    var initComponent = new InitComponent(false, new IEffect[] { effect, registerReactEffect }, null);
    return new Modifier(id, genId, name, initComponent, null, null, null,
    	new SingleTargetComponent(), null);
});
```

A basic dispel mechanic can also be implemented with react callbacks.

```csharp
Add("InitStatusEffectSleep_RemoveOnDispel", (id, genId, name, tag) =>
{
    var effect = StatusEffectEffect.Create(id, genId, StatusEffectType.Sleep, 5f, true);
    var removeEffect = RemoveEffect.Create(id, genId);

    var @event = new DispelEvent((target, source, eventTag) =>
    {
    	if ((tag & eventTag.ToInternalTag()) != 0)
    		removeEffect.Effect(target, source);
    });
    var registerReactEffect = new ReactCallbackRegisterEffect<ReactType>(
    	new ReactCallback<ReactType>(ReactType.Dispel, @event));

    removeEffect.SetRevertibleEffects(new IRevertEffect[] { effect, registerReactEffect });

    var initComponent = new InitComponent(false, new IEffect[] { effect, registerReactEffect }, null);
    return new Modifier(id, genId, name, initComponent, null, null, null,
    	new SingleTargetComponent(), null);
}, TagType.BasicDispel);
```

Then we can dispel this modifier with `Unit.Dispel(TagType.BasicDispel, Unit);`.

# FAQ

Q: ModiBuff.Units seems to use excessive casting in effects. Why not have a master unit interface?  
A: This was a tough solution to make custom user effects work with their own unit implementations.
And not force users to implement all methods for functionality, where it's not used.

Q: How do I make "insert mechanic from a game" in ModiBuff?  
A: First check [ModifierExamples.md](ModifierExamples.md). Then if it isn't there, ask about how to make it in issues,
will make a better
platform for discussion if needed.

Q: It's 100% not possible to make "mechanic from a game" in ModiBuff.  
A: If the mechanic is lacking internal ModiBuff functionality to work, and isn't an effect implementation problem, make
an issue about it. The goal of ModiBuff is to support as many unique mechanics as possible,
that don't rely on game logic.

Q: Why can't effects hold my/some kind of state? How else can I achieve this?  
A: Feeding mutable (non-stack) state to effects would introduce way too much complexity.
Instead we achieve this by using meta effects, and post effects on a secondary entity.
An example of this is a
[projectile](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/blob/d0ba95f8f0696572b9cfb4f3e1374c2fc5f57726/ModiBuff/ModiBuff.Tests/StateTests.cs#L270-L277).

Q: How to handle UI?  
A: There's two main ways of handling UI. The first general info is Modifier Name and Modifier Description,
through `ModifierRecipes.GetModifierInfo()`. There's also `ModifierController.GetApplier*()` methods for appliers info.
And `ModifierController.GetModifierReferences()` for normal modifiers. Basic usage is shown in the
[BasicConsole sample](https://github.com/Chillu1/ModiBuff/blob/d56ab4d1748e483a638b9ef7169a07413dbe3957/ModiBuff/ModiBuff.Examples/BasicConsole/UIExtensions.cs).

Q: I have a lot of modifiers, and care about memory usage (ex. mobile). What can I do?  
A: With huge amounts of modifier generators 500+ (recipes), and 10000+ units,
the memory usage of `ModifierController`s will be around 20MB. It can be lowered to 1MB±
by using `Config.UseDictionaryIndexes`, at a small performance cost.

Q: My stack effect is not working, what's wrong?  
A: StackEffectType needs to be set in all: `IEffect` (ex. DamageEffect), `Recipe.Effect.EffectOn.Stack`
and `Recipe.Stack()`  
Ex:

```csharp
Add("StackDamage")
    .Effect(new DamageEffect(5, StackEffectType.Effect/*<<THIS*/), EffectOn.Stack)
    .Stack(WhenStackEffect.Always);
```

# Internals

## Modifier lifetime process

Recipes are only a initial intermediate step, to tell the system how to create modifiers.
Recipes can also be fully skipped by using creating modifiers manually with the `ManualModifierGenerator` class.
Recipes and generators are only created once in the initialization process.

When the generators have been created, they're fed to the pool.
That supplies it's internal stacks with modifier instances.
There's a singleton pool that is used by every ModifierController.
